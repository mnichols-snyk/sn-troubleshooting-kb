​ Snyk Security for Application Vulnerability Response Integration Guide

1.​ Overview
Snyk is a Developer Security Platform that integrates directly into development tools and
automation pipelines. Snyk makes it easy to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in
code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code. Backed by industry-leading
vulnerability intelligence and designed by developers for developers, Snyk fits into your
development workflow to add security expertise to your toolkit.

Snyk ServiceNow Application
This application imports Snyk Projects and Snyk Issues data into ServiceNow as Application
Release, Scanned Applications, Application Vulnerable Item, Vulnerability, Application Scan
Summary, and Package in ServiceNow. It provides a user-friendly dashboard for data visualization
and supports filtering issues to be ingested.

1.1.​ Application features
The main features of the integration include:
1.​ Deliver Snyk security insights on vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies seamlessly
into a ServiceNow workflow
2.​ Provide visibility into your development team’s application security risk on both
platforms
3.​ Enable AppSec managers to create automated workflow processes to minimize risk and
guide developer teams to focus on the highest priorities.
4.​ Synchronize vulnerability exceptions between ServiceNow and Snyk
5.​ Calculate vulnerability risk and determine prioritization using ServiceNow’s vulnerability
calculators combined with Snyk’s industry-leading intelligence
6.​ Consolidate vulnerabilities and security outcomes, giving security teams visibility into
end-to-end workflow management
7.​ Bidirectional functionality to ignore and unignore vulnerabilities using the ServiceNow
exception or false positive workflows from ServiceNow to Snyk
8.​ Support the US, AU, and EU regions of Snyk

1.2.​ Compatibility Matrix
ServiceNow Version:
●​ Xanadu, Yokohama and Zurich
Snyk API Version:
●​ REST for projects and Organizations, SAST, SCA, IaC(US/AU/EU region)
●​ V1/reporting for SCA & IaC Issues(US region)

3.​ Configuration Instructions for New Installation AND Upgrades
3.1.​

Update Required After App Install/Upgrade – Snyk Base URL Change
Background: Snyk has recently migrated its platform hosting for new customers to
AWS. Existing customers will continue to be hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
New customer still has option to opt for GCP.
What’s Changing in the ServiceNow App?
In this release of the ServiceNow Snyk Integration, the base URL will default to the new
AWS URL: https://app.us.snyk.io
This means:
●​ If you are a new Snyk customer on AWS, you do not need to make any changes.
●​ If you are an existing or new Snyk customer on GCP, you need to update the
base URL in your integration to continue syncing correctly.
If your Snyk organization is still hosted on GCP, follow these steps after upgrading the
app:
●​ Open Global Settings and go to base URL and change URL to app.snyk.io for GCP

​
​

​
How to Know if You’re on AWS or GCP?

​ Snyk Security for Application Vulnerability Response Integration Guide

If you're unsure which platform you're hosted on:
●​ Log in to your Snyk account and check the URL in your browser.
○​ If it’s app.us.snyk.io, you’re on AWS.
○​ If it’s app.snyk.io, you’re on GCP.

Important Note: Customers hosted in the us.snyk.io (AWS) region MUST use the
REST APIs.

3.2.​

Permission and Roles
Note: By default x_snyk2_snyk_vr_in.configure_integration will be added under
sn_vul.app_configure_integrations.

This section describes how to automatically ignore & unignore a list of Snyk issues (AVITs) from
ServiceNow to Snyk using Exception rules.
Role Required : sn_vul.app_manage_auto_exception_rule
Procedure :
1.​ Navigate to All > Application Vulnerability Response > Administration > Exception Rules.
2.​ Create a new Exception rule specify the filter conditions submit & Approve it.

3.​ Once the exception rule is approved, a remediation task is created in a deferred state.
Starting from the "Valid from" to "Valid to" date, the exception rule runs on all the AVITs
that are
a.​ newly created
b.​ moved from the Closed to the Open state.
c.​ If “execute on existing data” is enabled then a scheduled job runs once on the
existing data on the "Valid from" date.
After the “Deferred until” date the exception rule expires and all the AVITs are moved to
open state again.
4.​ When an AVIT is moved to the Deferred state by an exception rule, it is also
automatically marked as "ignored" in the Snyk platform, with the expiration date set to
the "Deferred Until" date defined in the exception rule.
5.​ When an AVIT is moved to open state from deferred due to expiration of the exception
rule, the same ignore is unignored from the Issue in Snyk platform.
​

System properties (optional)
Role required: System Administrator
Update the values in the system properties only if required. Changing values of system property
can impact the integration. Below are the details of the system properties. Users can go to
system properties by typing sys_properties.LIST and the filtering properties with app scope.

4.13.​

Properties

Use Case

x_snyk2_snyk_vr_in.pageSize

Page size for SCA & IaC Issues for V1 Integration

x_snyk2_snyk_vr_in.pageSizeProjects

Page size for Projects

x_snyk2_snyk_vr_in.request_timeout

When making a Snyk API request, this time will be
utilized to wait for a response (in seconds).

x_snyk2_snyk_vr_in.retry

The API call will be retried this many times.

x_snyk2_snyk_vr_in.until_date

This will be implemented when updating the state
from ServiceNow to Snyk. If the "AVIT Request
Exception until date" exceeds 365 days, the issue
will be ignored permanently. The default value is
set to 365 days, but you can adjust it to a value
below 365 days as needed.

x_snyk2_snyk_vr_in.waitTime

Wait time for subsequent API calls if a timeout
error occurs in Snyk API (in milliseconds).

CI LookUp rule
●​ Below are the steps to follow if your ServiceNow instance stores Snyk Applications in the
"sn_vul_app_scanned_application" table and you want to create or use existing CIs
(Configuration Items) when creating Discovered Applications for Snyk applications.
●​ Make sure the system property (sn_vul.use_product_model) is false. For verification,
follow the steps below.
○​ Navigate to sys_properties.LIST
○​ Search for sn_vul.use_product_model

○​ The value should be false. If not, change it to false.

​ Snyk Security for Application Vulnerability Response Integration Guide

○​ If the sn_vul.use_product_model value is true, it will create a product model. If
you choose that approach, you must create a Lookup rule with a lookup target
Product Model.
Note: If your ServiceNow instance stores Snyk projects in a CMDB class other than the
"sn_vul_app_scanned_application" table, then you need to create your own look-up
rule but ensure you keep the source field as source_app_id. (Note: If you’re using tags to
match the record, then it will consider the tag value of the tag mentioned in the global
settings module of the integration; otherwise, it will consider the project ID.) Follow the
steps below to create the Lookup rule.
●​ Navigate to Security Operations -> CMDB -> Lookup Rules.

●​ Click on the New button to create a new Lookup rule.

●​ Give a Unique Name—for example, "Snyk Product Rule."

●​ Select "Field matching" in the Lookup Method. Use a custom script if the table is not
present in the list.
●​ Select Source as Snyk Application Security.
●​ Select Lookup target as Product Model or Configuration item based on requirement.
●​ Select the Table name where your ServiceNow stored application data is Search on the
product table.
●​ In the Source field, give the product table a unique name that should map to the
application field name. ( Application fields: app_name, source_app_id)
●​ Click on the Update Button.
●​ Similarly, users can create CI lookups for other CMDB tables if needed.
●​ Make sure your CMDB matching field has the exact same value as the Snyk project tags
value/project ID to map correct CIs.
●​ Note: Any customization to the existing lookup rule or new lookup rule that is created
will never override in future upgrades, as ServiceNow doesn’t override customer
updates by default.
●​ Refer to the link below for more info about creating CI Look-up rule:
https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-security-management/page/produc
t/security-operations-common/task/create-ci-identifier-rules.html.
●​ From v3.1.0 onwards, the sourcepayload will include full project details from the
API, enabling more advanced and specific CI lookup rule matching.
The payload contains comprehensive project metadata, including:
●​ Project ID, name, and type​
●​ Latest issue and dependency counts​
●​ Target file and Git reference​
●​ Origin and status​
●​ Organization and target relationships (including URLs)​
●​ Importer info​

1.​ Snyk Assignment Rule Based On Project Tags
a.​ If you want to assign AVIT based on project tags, use this assignment
rule. To use this assignment rule, you need to make below changes.
// 1. Declare tags key and values
var tags = {
"CMDBID" : ["java-goof", "democheck1234"]
}; // Add key value pair of tags. for example:
"<tags-key>": ["tags-value1", "<tags-value2>"]
// 2. two option available for assigning avit group and
user. By default it will check for user.
var whomToAssign = "user";

// Replace with group if

you want to assign AVIT to group
// 3. Mapping of tags value and sys id of user/group.
var sysIdOfUserOrGroupBasedOnTags = {
"java-goof": "afdf1ee287d9421015f3c91e0ebb357a",
"democheck1234": "afdf1ee287d9421015f3c91e0ebb357a"
}; // If you want to assign user to AVIT which has
<tag-value> in discovered application/projects. then
delcare it in above dict like "<tag-value>"" : "<sys-id
of user/group>"
// 4. Logic to map appropriate user/group to AVIT

b.​ Check comments in the code and update the codebase accordingly so it
works seamlessly with your data and mark it as active.

2.​ Snyk assignment rule
a.​ This assignment rule verifies the presence of any business application
record with tag values corresponding to a Business App name. If such a
record exists, it will associate the managed by group of the business
application to the AVIT. Change the code below according to your
requirements.

scope. You can copy the sys_id of jo by right-clicking on the record.
var gr = new GlideRecord("sn_sec_cmn_background_job");
if (gr.get("<sys_id of background job>")){
​
gr.state = "complete";
​
gr.update();
}
●​ Run the Snyk integration again.

7.2.14.​

Unable to ignore an issue from ServiceNow to Snyk. Getting 403 Error in Outbound
HTTP Calls.
●​ Open the Snyk platform at the organization level. Go to Settings.

●​ In General settings, You must select "All users in any environment" to successfully ignore
the issue.
●​ To restrict the ability of developers to ignore issues in Snyk without ignoring them in
ServiceNow, a custom group role must be created in the Snyk UI at the Group level that

does not allow members of that group to ignore items. Then, developers who should not
be allowed to add an ignore in Snyk must be added to that group. See this
documentation from Snyk on how to create the custom roles:
https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/manage-permissions-and-roles/user-role-management.

7.3.1.​

Known Behaviors
Vulnerability Integration fails when one integration is running and the second
integration is executed.
●​ Snyk uses the ServiceNow default OAuth2 mechanism to manage tokens. The OAuth
credentials table is only accessible by the token owner, a user with the "maint" role, or a
system admin.
●​ Because of the limitations of the read ACL, the Snyk integration run fails when run as the
user VR.system while a job with that user is still running.
●​ The vulnerability response scheduler runs the integration as a VR.system user when one
job is already running and the second executes.
●​ To avoid this case, don’t manually execute a Snyk import job when one run is already in
process. If you want to run an integration job, then cancel the running integration run
and retry.

7.3.2.​

The Snyk application vulnerable item is in the open state even if the Snyk issue is
fixed in the Snyk platform.
●​ If the first ingestion of the Snyk issue does not contain CVEs, but the second ingestion of
the same Snyk issue does, two AVITs are made for that issue.
○​ AVIT that refers to the third-party vulnerability
○​ AVIT that refers to the particular CVE
●​ If the Snyk issue is fixed on the Snyk side, only the AVIT that refers to the CVE will be
closed, while the other AVIT will remain open.
●​ To avoid this case, follow the steps below to close AVIT manually.
○​ Navigate to the Application Vulnerable Item "Application Vulnerability
Response." Under it, click "Vulnerable Items" and then select "All."
○​ Filter as "Source" "is" "Snyk," and then click on "Run" to view all the issues that
are fetched from the Snyk.
○​ Click the AVIT record that you want to close manually.
○​ Click on the "Close" UI action.

7.3.3.​

​ Snyk Security for Application Vulnerability Response Integration Guide

The state of existing AVIT will not update from "Deferred" to Open when Triaging in
ServiceNow is selected.
●​ An AVIT already fetched with Triaging in ServiceNow as false in vulnerability
filtering will have a "Deferred" state if ignore is true. When Triaging in
ServiceNow is selected, and integration is executed again, the existing AVIT state
won’t be updated to Open, as ServiceNow doesn’t allow changing the state
automatically if it is deferred.
●​ If you want to change the state from "Deferred" to "Open," you must do so
manually. ServiceNow doesn’t override the "Deferred" state to "Open."

7.3.4.​

Recently Ignored issues on the Snyk side could take ~5 hours to reflect in SCA V1
API.
●​ When the user ignores the issue from ServiceNow or manually ignores the SCA
or IaC issue, it could take up to ~5 hours to reflect in GET v1 API.

7.3.5.​

Additional comments and state updates on the Snyk side may take up to ~9 hours
in the US region. Typical performance is right away.
●​ When a user marks an AVIT as "Mark as False positive" or "Request Exception,"
then the "Additional comment" added by the user and the state of the issue will
be updated to the Snyk platform after 9 hours (Ref).
●​ While changing the state of vulnerability from ServiceNow to Snyk, wait at least
9 hours to compare the state on Snyk with ServiceNow.

7.3.6.​

Users must be added to the approver group for performing "Mark as False positive"
and "Request Exception."
●​ When the user marks an AVIT as "Mark as False Positive" or "Request
Exception," the AVIT state will be set to "In Review," and the request must be
approved.

○​ For users to approve the request of "Mark as False Positive," they must
be in the "False Positive Approver" group.
○​ Users must be in the Application Exception Approver-Level 1 group to
approve the request of "Request Exception."
○​ If users are not added to the group, the Request will be automatically
rejected, as per ServiceNow VR default behavior.
●​ To avoid this case, ensure users are added to the approver group for performing
"Mark as False positive" and "Request Exception."

7.3.7.​

Users must initiate the Reapply calculator's UI action inside the VR scope.
●​

7.3.8.​

Unable to "Mark as False positive" or "Request Exception" for IaC issues.
●​

●​

7.3.9.​

If the user has set the REST mechanism for fetching the IaC issues in Global
Settings and fetched IaC issues from integration, the integration cannot set
an ignore on the Snyk platform.
Release 3.0.0 version does not support the "Mark as false positive" or
"Request exception" for IaC issues fetched from REST integration.

Use of "Move Project" V1 Snyk API can lead to unexpected results in SN Integration.
●​

7.3.10.​

If the user wants to change or reapply the Snyk calculator, ensure this is done
in the Vulnerability Response scope.

Using the Snyk V1 "Move Projects" API to move a project will result in
unexpected results, including the likelihood that the AVITs associated with
the project will become orphaned in ServiceNow. The recommended process
is to delete the target in Snyk and re-import the project into the new Org.

OAuth Process
●​

Date: 8th August, 2025​ ​

Snyk now allows customers to have a "Tenant" with multiple Groups.
Customers may only select orgs from a single group during the OAuth
process. A single integration will not import data across multiple groups due
to the permission boundaries of the OAuth tokens.

​

The OAuth token process can only grant authorization to a SINGLE Org or all Orgs. Selecting
multiple Orgs is currently unavailable and will be included in a future release.​
